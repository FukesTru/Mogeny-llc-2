# Mogeny LLC website

The website for Mogeny LLC (Chicago, IL), built from the Local Cascade client site template.
This repo is a second design of that site, copied from FukesTru/Mogeny-LLC and restyled after
lemondropaccounting.com (bright blush and lemon look, bold Montserrat headings). The words and pages are the same.
Business details are in `site.json`. What the client still has to send or confirm is in
`VERIFY.md`. The site itself is the plain HTML in `public/`.

# Client website template

A starting point for one client website built by Local Cascade. Each client gets their own copy
of this repo on GitHub, deployed by Vercel from the `main` branch.

Open the client's copy in Claude Code and say what you want. Claude reads `CLAUDE.md`, works on a
branch, opens a pull request, gives you the Vercel preview link, and puts it live when you say
"ship it". The review address is the `preview_url` in `site.json` (`https://<project>.vercel.app`)
until the client's own domain is connected at go-live.

To start a new client: copy this template into a new repo, import that repo into Vercel as a new
project (no framework, no build command, output directory `public`; `vercel.json` already sets
this), and fill in `vercel_project` and `preview_url` in `site.json`.

Do not edit this template to fix one client's site; fix it in that client's repo.
